Known bugs: 
css bacground tint will not play nice. Cuts off at the bottom. Otherwise scales correctly, Id like to tweak it more so it "floats" and takes up only the space required to highlight the text propery, either in box form or for lack of better term word wrap (mabe) on the latter (depending on how it looks) so that the earth background image can bee seen undimmed

Main image is to large filesize i need to convert and scale it down without compromising noticable quality on high res sceens (4k, 8k) 

For mobile browsers, i need to force landscape viewing (only for index.php) due to the text looking horid otherwise.
